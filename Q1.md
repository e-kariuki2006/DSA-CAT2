Big O Notation is used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of time and space complexity
i)Ignore Constants
   O(2n) -> O(n)
   
ii)Focus on Dominant term
   O(n2 + n) -> O(n2)
   
iii)Consider input size changes - where you consider logarithimic growth if the input size reduces.

iv)Drop non dominant terms
    O(n+n2+logn) ->O(n2)
